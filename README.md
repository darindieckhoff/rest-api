Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Project #11 - Rest API

In this project, you’ll create a REST API using Express. 
The API will provide a way for users to review educational courses: 
  *users can see a list of courses in a database; 
  *add courses to the database; 
  *and add reviews for a specific course.

To complete this project, you’ll use your knowledge of REST API design, Node.js, and Express to create API routes, 
along with Mongoose and MongoDB for data modeling, validation, and persistence.
